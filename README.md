# R_Workshop

Hi friends, for this workshop we will be focusing on:

1. Introduction of R
2. Setting up R environment (e.g., importing libraries, setting directories, etc)
3. Basic R Syntax and Data Structures 
4. Data Analysis and Visualization in R (using ggplot2, and simple statistical analyses) 

To save time, I would like to ask you to all download R and RStudio

Download R here
For Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
For Mac: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

Download R Studio: (make sure to pick windows/mac) 
https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/

(R Studio allows you to write scripts and save them for future use, while R is just a command window) 

In this github page you will also find an example Rscript and a sample datasheet for us to practice on.
Please download both before the workshop. 

DATA VISUALIZATION GOALS: 
A. Demonstrate how to create correlations & boxplots stratified by categories 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS GOALS: 
A. Demonstrate how to run tests of normality/heteroscedasticity (Shapiroâ€“Wilk, Levene's)
B. Run ttests, anovas, linear mixed effect models 

Additionally, if you'd like to analyze your own data or want to learn any additional statistical methods, 
please email me in advance (by Tuesday) so I can prepare further material for you. I encourage you to come
with your own datasets to practice and ask questions!
